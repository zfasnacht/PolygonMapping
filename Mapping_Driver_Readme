This Readme describes the python driver map_driver.py which uses the function make_map to plot polygons on map for user chosen data

Command line script to run:
	
	python map_driver.py -fname -pname -dfield -outfile -geobounds -cbarbounds -cbartype

	Required Arguments:
		-fname   or --fname   The name of the data file for which user would like data to be plotted
			Example -fname OMI-Aura_L2-OMTO3_2006m0513t2104-o09722_v999-2017m0201t175858.he5

		-pname   or --pname   The name of the PIXCOR file that user would like data to be plotted with 
			Example -pname OMI-Aura_L2-OMPIXCOR_2006m0921t1953-o11629_v003-2018m0228t230824.he5

		-dfield  or --dfield  The datafield that the user would like plotted for given filename. User can input just datafield or datafield and full path including groups (including
				      the full path is safer way of using in case that the datafield is in multiple groups, otherwise datafield may be taken from wrong group)
			Example -dfield /HDFEOS/SWATHS/OMI Column Amount O3/Data Fields/Reflectivity340

		-outfile or --outfile The name of the output file that user would like for plot with extension included 
			Example -outfile 2006m0513_o11629_R340.jpg
	
	Optional Arguments:
		
		-geobounds  or --geobounds  List of lat/lon bounds user would like map to be created with (lon_min,lon_max,lat_min,lat_max)
			Default is [-180,180,-90,90]
			Example [30,100,-60,60] will make a map from 30E-100E Longitude and 60S-60N Latitude

		-cbarbounds or --cbarbounds List of colorbar bounds user would like plot to use (cbar_min,cbar_max,number of steps)
			Default is [10th percentile, 90th percentile, 10 steps]
			Example [1,5,5] will map a colorbar where the min value is 1, max value is 5, and there are 5 increments 

		-cbartype   or --cbartype   Type of colorbar user would like: continuous, discrete, or list for custom colorbar. 
			Optional colorbar type arguments are as followed:
			'continuous' -> plt.cm.jet colorbar...rainbow like colorbar
			'discrete' -> Dark Blue to cyan colorbar
			[colora,colorb,colorc] Example ['blue','orange','red'] will create a colorbar where blue is min value on colorbar, orange is middle range color, and red is max range color, 
			    			       code will "smear" colors between the given colors to give full colorbar for colorbar range and steps provided by user	
			Default: continuous
