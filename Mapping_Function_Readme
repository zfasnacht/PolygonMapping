This Readme describes the python function make_map which can be imported from map_script.py (ie from map_script import make_map)

make_map(data,lon_corners,lat_corners,geo_bounds,cbar_bounds,cbar_type,cbar_label,fig_name)

	data: array or scalar 
		The data for the mapping function to plot in colors on map 
	lon_corners: ndarray Multiple Pologons -> SHAPE(num corners * num polygons) Single polygon -> SHAPE(num corners)
		The longitude corners for polygons user would like plotted
	lat_corners: ndarray Multiple Pologons -> SHAPE(num corners * num polygons) Single polygon -> SHAPE(num corners)
		The latitude corners for polygons user would like plotted
	geo_bounds: array (lon_min,lon_max,lat_min,lat_max), optional	
		The longitude and latitude bounds user would like for plot
		Default is (-180,180,-90,90)
	cbar_bounds: array (min,max,num steps), optional
		The colorbar bounds and number of increments user would like in colorbar
		Default is (10th percentile, 90th percentile, 10 steps)
	cbar_type: list or string, optional 
		The type of colorbar user would like, ie continuous or discrete. User can also input list of personal colorbar. 
		Optional colorbar type arguments are as followed:
			'continuous' -> plt.cm.jet colorbar...rainbow like colorbar
			'discrete' -> Dark Blue to cyan colorbar
			[colora,colorb,colorc] Ex. ['blue','orange','red'] will create a colorbar where blue is min value on colorbar, orange is middle range color, and red is max range color, 
			    			   code will "smear" colors between the given colors to give full colorbar for colorbar range and steps provided by user	
		Default: continuous 
	cbar_label: string, optional 
		Label User would like to use for colorbar
		Default: ''		
	fig_name: string
		Filename user would like to save map as including file extension
